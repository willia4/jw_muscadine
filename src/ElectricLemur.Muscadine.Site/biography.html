<p>James is a standard issue nerd, practically to a fault.
He was learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">BASIC</a> while his peers were learning to throw and catch.
He enjoys walking around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIV">a well-lit 3D-rendered landscape</a> but would prefer to stay indoors.
He won't dance (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaVByEQsxtw">don't ask him</a>) but he will <code>/dance</code> and <code>/manderville</code> all night long.
If you're interested in an in-depth analysis between the command techniques of various Starfleet captains, you are going to have a great
time with James at parties (this is a lie: James doesn't go to parties).</p>

<p>Professionally, James is a seasoned developer with nearly two decades of experience. He enjoys all sorts of different programming languages,
platforms, and programming methodologies. His own personal style is a spicy mix of functional and object-oriented: he even nearly understands
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3870088/a-monad-is-just-a-monoid-in-the-category-of-endofunctors-whats-the-problem">monads</a>!</p>

<p>When he's not working, he's probably poking at <a href="https://github.com/willia4/">his personal programming projects</a>.
  Beyond that: you might find him playing a turn-based RPG (or watching a Let's Play of a more action-oriented RPG), editing pictures in Photoshop,
  reading a novel with a spaceship on the cover, and always always always drinking far more <a href="https://www.yorkshiretea.com/">tea</a> than
  can possibly be wise.</p>
